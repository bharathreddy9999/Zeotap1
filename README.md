Overview
This is a Google Sheets Clone built with simple web technologies (HTML, CSS, and JavaScript). It allows you to create and manipulate a spreadsheet-like grid, apply basic formatting, perform mathematical operations, and handle data transformations (like trimming, case conversion, removing duplicates, and more).

Tech Stack
HTML: Structures the webpage and sets up the spreadsheet table.
CSS: Styles the user interface, making the spreadsheet resemble a typical sheet/grid.
Vanilla JavaScript: Implements logic for creating, formatting, resizing rows/columns, applying formulas, and more.
Why This Tech Stack?

Simplicity: Using Vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS keeps the project light, easy to understand, and straightforward to modify.
Browser Support: Most modern browsers support these core technologies without additional tooling.
Learning & Demonstration: It's an excellent project to demonstrate DOM manipulation, event handling, and basic data handling in JavaScript.
Data Structures & Approach
DOM (Document Object Model):

Instead of using a complex in-memory data structure (like a 2D array or custom classes), this project leverages the DOM itself. Each cell in the table is directly edited through the contentEditable property.
The spreadsheet is essentially a <table> element where each <tr> represents a row and each <td> represents a cell.
Row and Column Headers:

The headers (A, B, C... for columns and 1, 2, 3... for rows) are generated by mapping character codes (for columns) and numbering rows.
In-Cell Data Storage:

Each cell's text is stored in its inner text (cell.innerText).
When performing formulas or transformations, the necessary data is pulled from the DOM (the cell’s text) and processed.
Formula Parsing:

Simple string operations split the formula (e.g., =SUM(A1:A3)), identify the function (SUM, AVERAGE, etc.), and parse the cell range (A1:A3).
A regex pattern (/^([A-Z]+)(\d+):([A-Z]+)(\d+)$/) extracts the start and end cells.
Event-Driven Updates:

Click events are used to highlight or select an active cell.
Drag-and-drop events are used to move cell data from one place to another.
Prompts are used to request user input for text color, find-and-replace, and removing duplicates.
This approach keeps the logic transparent and the code more direct, without the overhead of maintaining a separate data model.

Features
Spreadsheet Grid:

Dynamically creates an initial 10x10 grid.
Each cell is editable and can be resized by dragging column/row headers.
Formula Bar:

Supports basic mathematical functions: SUM, AVERAGE, MAX, MIN, COUNT, MEDIAN, and PRODUCT.
Takes a formula like =SUM(A1:A3) and applies it to the active cell.
Formatting Tools:

Bold / Italic toggling.
Change Text Color.
Row & Column Management:

Add or delete rows and columns.
Data Quality Tools:

Trim: Removes leading and trailing spaces.
Case Conversion: Uppercase, Lowercase, Title Case.
Reverse Text: Reverses text in the selected cell.
Remove Duplicates: Removes duplicate rows in a given range.
Find & Replace: Searches and replaces text in a specified range.
Drag-and-Drop:

Move data between cells by dragging and dropping.
Usage
Download or Clone the repository.
Open the index.html file in your favorite browser.
Make sure style.css and script.js are located in the same directory (or adjust paths if needed).
An initial 10x10 spreadsheet table will appear.
Begin Editing:
Click a cell to select it.
Use the top toolbar to apply formatting or add/delete rows and columns.
Type formulas in the formula bar (=SUM(A1:A3)) and click Apply Formula.
Explore data quality features like Find & Replace, Remove Duplicates, etc.
How It Works
Initialization:

createSpreadsheet(10, 10) generates a 10x10 grid with row and column headers.
Adds event listeners for clicking cells, editing text, and drag-and-drop functionality.
Applying Formulas:

The formula is read from the input field.
A regular expression identifies the function and cell range.
The cell values are retrieved from the DOM, converted to numbers, and the result is written back to the selected cell.
Formatting:

When you click Bold or Italic, the script toggles the CSS style properties (fontWeight, fontStyle) of the active cell.
Row/Column Resizing:

A small div (handle) is appended to each header cell that, when dragged, adjusts the width or height of that column/row.
Data Quality Utilities:

Trim: Simple string .trim() on the active cell’s text.
Case Conversions: .toUpperCase(), .toLowerCase(), or custom logic for Title Case.
Remove Duplicates: Uses a Set to track row data in a given range; duplicates are removed by deleting the corresponding table row.
Find & Replace: Searches within the specified range and uses .replace() to swap text.
